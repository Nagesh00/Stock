# 🎯 Back to Original Structure

## What Went Wrong
You're absolutely right - I overcomplicated the original simple structure by:
1. ❌ Adding complex built-in technical indicators when TA-Lib should just be optional
2. ❌ Making dependency management overly complex
3. ❌ Creating fallback systems that weren't needed
4. ❌ Adding unnecessary abstraction layers

## Original Simple Structure (Restored)

### The system was meant to be:
1. **Simple requirements.txt** - Standard libraries that work out of the box
2. **Optional TA-Lib** - Use if available, skip if not  
3. **Direct service execution** - `python services/data-ingestion/main.py`
4. **Basic Docker setup** - `docker-compose up -d`
5. **Clear documentation** - Follow README.md and getting-started.md

### Let's restore to original simplicity:
- ✅ Keep core functionality working
- ✅ Remove complex fallback systems  
- ✅ Use standard dependencies only
- ✅ Follow the documented approach
- ✅ Make it "just work" as originally intended

## Next Steps
1. Simplify requirements.txt to core libraries
2. Remove complex technical indicators module
3. Restore original service structure
4. Follow the documented workflow exactly

You were right to point this out - the original structure was much cleaner!
